    <div class="recipe_description">
        <p>Beef Nilaga or Nilagang Baka is literally translated as “Boiled Beef”. This is a simple soup dish best served during rainy and cold weather. Have you noticed the similarity of this dish to that of the Bulalo and Beef Pochero? I highly recommend this dish to those who are learning how to cook because it takes almost no effort at all to prepare (just have patience in tenderizing the meat). This was actually the first dish that Ive tried after fried egg.</p>
